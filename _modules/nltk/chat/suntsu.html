   <span class="s">&quot;By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier&#39;s minds.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

   <span class="s">&quot;Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
   <span class="s">&quot;In war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
